# Event Management System 

This is the second group project undertaken by myself, @fangxin-tang, @dorachenxiW, @nayxie, and @SimonEccleston over a span of 6 weeks from September to October, 2023. It served as the final assessment for the COMP639 Studio Project at Lincoln University. 

The project entailed the development of a `full-stack web application` that utilises `Python and Flask` for the backend, `Jinja` templating, `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` for the frontend, along with a `MySQL` database.
